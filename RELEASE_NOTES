trunk (some of these happened in earlier releases but this file has not been updated)

* some code cleanup: removed the dataclasses header backports
  -> this version will not work with outdated dataclasses
* minor OpenCL cleanups to make some implementations happy
* safeprimes file will now be taken from I3_DATA if it exists
* added a benchmark script which can be used to check the GPU/CPU
  performance by propagating a couple of photons
* more cleanups to move from I3MCPulse to I3MCPE
* fixed a bug where the MCTree chopping would ignore secondary losses
  leading to light from muon stochastic losses to be ignored
  when looking at data pre-processed with CMC

Release V00-03-00

* support for ice tilt and anisotropy
* tuned when running on AMD cards (Radeon 7970 on cobaltamdgpu)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-02-01

* replaces the OpenCL 1.1 version of the cl.hpp OpenCL C++ bindings
  with the 1.2 version. This currently breaks compatibility with
  some older OpenCL 1.0 implementations (notably Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard),
  but allows clsim to be compiled with newer versions of the AMD APP SDK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-02-00

* fixes a bug where particles that fall below the Cherenkov threshold are immediately killed in Geant4
* allows "device fission" to be used to make the photon propagator only use a fixed number of cores
* can send statistics to a I3SummaryService
* includes a new propagation mode where absorption is ignored (for generating photon-tables)
* comes with a preliminary version of photon-tabulation code
* flashers now have the appropriate time delay distributions
* allows Standard Candle simulation
* I3PhotonSeriesMap is now based on ModuleKey instead of OMKey (if available)
* support mDOM simulations when compatible dataclasses are available
* the safeprimes auto-downloader should be compatible with more systems now
* oversized DOMs are compressed to ellipsoids to get better timing distributions

Release V00-01-05

This is a minor release that should improve compatibility with
older nVidia cards (such as GTX 295) that do not have as much GPU
memory as newer cards. The maximum amount of memroy will now
only be used on nVidia cards that have either "Tesla", "GTX 580"
or "GTX 680" in their names.

Performance for large I3MCTrees should be significantly
improved in this release.
