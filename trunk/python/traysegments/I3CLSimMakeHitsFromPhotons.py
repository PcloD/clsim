    Convert I3Photons into I3MCHits. This applies the DOM
    angular acceptance (and wavenelgth acceptance in case
    you are using the unbiased photon propagation mode.)

    :param MCTreeName:
        The name of the I3MCTree containing the particles to propagate.
    :param PhotonSeriesName:
        Name of the input I3PhotonSeriesMap to be converted.
    :param MCHitSeriesName:
        Name of the output I3MCHitSeriesMap written by the module.
        Set this to None to prevent generating MCHits from
        Photons.
    :param SimulateAfterPulses:
        Use an algorithm from hit-maker to simulate after-pulses.
        Turn this on to be compatble to hit-maker with afer-pulse
        simulation. This also includes PMT jitter simulation (2ns).
        Do not use this when using external after-pulse simulation modules.
    :param RandomService:
        Set this to an instance of a I3RandomService. Alternatively,
        you can specify the name of a configured I3RandomServiceFactory
        added to I3Tray using tray.AddService(). If you don't configure
        this, the default I3RandomServiceFactory will be used.
    :param DOMOversizeFactor:
        Set the DOM oversize factor. To disable oversizing, set this to 1.
    :param UnshadowedFraction:
        Fraction of photocathode available to receive light (e.g. unshadowed by the cable)
    :param UseHoleIceParameterization:
        Use an angular acceptance correction for hole ice scattering.
    :param If:
        Python function to use as conditional execution test for segment modules.
