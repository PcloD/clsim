This is an attempt to make clsim tabulate photon detection probabilities in a 
manner similar to photonics. It does not yet work.

The general idea (partially implemented in stepgenerator.py) is as follows:
1. Replace I3CLSimStepToPhotonConverterOpenCL's realistic DOM arrangement with a grid of detectors centered on the source and aligned with its direction. All other elements of tracking remain the same.
2. Generate steps for some source, keeping track of the total number of photons
3. Inject these into clsim and harvest the results, adding an entry to some histogram for each detected photon 
4. Normalize the detection probability in each bin to the number of propagated photons.
5. Profit!
