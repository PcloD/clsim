This directory contains scripts that allow the user to compare clsim to ppc.
The file comparePPCtoCLSim.sh can be used as a starting point for generating
an example muon-only .i3 file, simulating its photons with ppc and clsim and
comparing the results.

Note that PPC removes events that do not contain any hits from the event file.
You need to patch PPC in order to make the comparison fair. (These events might
have hits generated by clsim, but it will not see them since they already have
been removed.) Also note that clsim currently does not simulate ice layer tilt,
so you should disable that functionality in PPC if you want to compare the photon
tracking.
